# kan_diabetes
In this repo, I am trying to implement the Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KAN) on a diabetes dataset.

## Updates
This repo was updated on 5/28/2024. Changes were made to the branch to improve formula calculations.

## Updates Made
- Implemented additional preprocessing steps for the diabetes dataset.
- Integrated symbolic regression to derive formulas.
 Improved the model plots before and after training.
 Added `train_acc()` and `test_acc()` functions to the `model.train()` function.
- Improved accuracy calculation and pruned model plotting.

## Suggestions
- Consider implementing feature engineering for understanding the features present.
- One-Hot Encoding the categorical variables and building a correlation matrix.
- Train the model with the loss function formula.

## Credits
The initial thought and inspiration for the model was by [Chukwuebuka Ezeokeke (Gaus Octavio)](https://github.com/Chukwuebuka-2003).

This project was updated and enhanced by [Chris D](https://github.com/ChrisD-7).
